# HandProsthesisEMG
Final Project for Biomedical Engineering ITS

This final project lies on the creation of Hand Prosthesis which includes programming for microcontroller (STM32F4) with C++.
The use of microcontroller would be for receiver from EMG electrodes as well as the brain for controlling motor movements in the Hand Prosthesis.
